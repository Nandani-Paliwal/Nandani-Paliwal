<p>
I am Nandani, a Frontend Developer obsessed with animations and compelling user interfaces. I like to build smooth user experiences via animations and visually appealing web interfaces. I am also leaned towards the product side of the software application and I believe that the interfaces we build are not just meant to look good, but should serve the purpose which is the user's satisfaction.
